I am a motivated and driven fourth-year student pursuing a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Khulna University of Engineering & Technology.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained invaluable insights into the world of engineering, understanding the significance of applying classical strategies to contemporary projects. My passion lies in harnessing technology to solve real-world problems efficiently.

I pride myself on being a self-taught Python developer, driven by a deep curiosity for Machine Learning. My dedication to honing these skills has equipped me with proven and tested coding abilities, complemented by a strong foundation in computing. Moreover, my adeptness in communication allows me to convey complex technical concepts effectively.
