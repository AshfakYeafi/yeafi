title: Autonomous Mobile Robot from scratch in ROS environment.
description: I make the design in Fusion 360 and then convert the file in URDF format. And then deploy this model in the ROS environment. I use a lidar sensor for making a 2D map using gmapping and at last using SLAM I autonomously controlled the robot.
